This project will help you to upload your first web application in Cloud
We have used Heroku (PaaS) to deploy the model & Flask for the application UI
Hence, the primary objective behind this project was to look for the performance rather than the accuracy  
This app will take 6 inputs from user & will predict whether the inputs are Diabetic or Not
Logistic Regression has been used for binary classification
ROC - 0.76 & Recall - 0.73
This model can be further improved using standard ML optimization techniques
