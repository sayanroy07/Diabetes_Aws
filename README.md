This project will help you to upload your first web application in AWS Cloud
We have used AWS (IaaS) to deploy the model & Flask for the application UI
Hence, the primary objective behind this project was to look for the performance rather than the accuracy  
This app will take 10 inputs from user & will predict whether the person is Diabetic or Not
XGBoost has been used for this model
ROC - 0.97 & Recall - 0.87
This model can be further improved using standard ML optimization techniques
